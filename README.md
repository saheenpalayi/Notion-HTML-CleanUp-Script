# Notion-HTML-CleanUp-Script

I've created the script to help my students who doing documentation in notion and exporting as HTMl to upload in their personal HTML website as part of the fabacademy 2024

## What is dose?
- Unzip and rename the folder and the html file to get rid of the unique ID generated by Notion 
- it replaces the file location inside the HTML to the correct path after rename
- it adds all video code snippets inside the HTML file 
- it replaces the notion's Indent spaces with "< br >" tags 
- it formats the HTML document properly for readability later

## How to use?
Just clone the repo or download it to ur PC and drop the notion HTMl Exported zip file inside the folder where the code is then open run.bat to run the script.
